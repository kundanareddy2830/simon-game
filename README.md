🎭 Theory Behind Simon Says Game
Simon Says is a classic memory game that challenges players to recall and reproduce an increasing sequence of signals. The game is based on pattern recognition and short-term memory retention. The core principles behind the implementation include:
Sequential Memory Processing: The game progressively increases the difficulty by adding more steps to the sequence.
Event-Driven Interaction: Player actions trigger events that determine if the sequence is correct.
Game Logic Control: A loop-based system tracks user input and compares it with the generated sequence to determine success or failure.
